Thank you for your interest in completing our coding test. 

We've found it's a very effective way to determine our applicants' skills baseline.


The process is simple: 

- We've provided the exact details of our coding test to those we have selected, and the same information has been sent to each person simultaneously

- There is no time limit to complete the test, but we will be reviewing the results as they are shared with us

- To ensure the process is fair to all, we won't be offering assistance or guidance

- There is no need to reach out if you no longer wish to participate, now that you have seen the full details
- We will be reaching out to select candidates to schedule an 30-min interview based on their submission


Why we've chosen this approach:

- Review of completed submissions offers us the information needed to determine skills alignment with our team and who best to schedule a one-on-one interview with

- If you feel this test/request is beyond what you signed up for, that's okâ€”we understand your time is precious


Here are the details:

Using Expo and React Navigation, build a basic app skeleton with two tabs on the bottom and a drawer that can be accessed on the left. (Each tabbed page can display text saying "tab 1", "tab2".)

There will be a button in the drawer saying "show me a joke," which will request a random joke from the endpoint here and immediately trigger a push notification to show on the device that displays the joke's setup. 

Upon clicking the notification, the drawer will close, and a new stacked page will open on top of the root tab view that displays the joke's delivery/punchline. (Full JokeAPI documentation can be found here.)

Feel free to take this further in any way you see fit (e.g. filters, etc.).

Please upload your project to GitHub and share the link once completed. 


Bonus Points: Publish the app to Expo and share the link, so we can immediately run the app on our devices without compiling the repo.


Thank you in advance for your participation, and good luck!
